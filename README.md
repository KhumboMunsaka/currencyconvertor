🏦 Currency Converter (React + Vercel Serverless API)
This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

A modern currency converter built with React, using Vercel Serverless Functions to securely handle the API key for CurrencyBeacon.
The frontend communicates with backend functions instead of calling the API directly, keeping the API key hidden even when deployed.
